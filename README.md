# NLP
Projects and notes from my NLP class â€“ text classification, embeddings, transformers, and more

This repository contains my notes, assignments, and projects from an NLP (Natural Language Processing) course. It covers core concepts and tasks such as text preprocessing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, language modeling, and modern transformer-based approaches.

The focus is on both foundational understanding and hands-on implementation of real-world NLP problems.
